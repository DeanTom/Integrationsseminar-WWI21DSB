# Introduction

Welcome to our Brachistochrone Curve Visualization Project! <br>
This repository hosts a captivating project developed by a group of dedicated university students during their 5th semester. Our primary goal was to bring to life one of the most fascinating phenomena in the realm of mathematics and physics — <b>the Brachistochrone Curve</b> — using the power of Python and the visualization framework Manim.
